Scalping bot for a PS5.

I was hanging out on Discord one night with my friends. For the past few months I had been working on a Discord bot for them and they loved it. I had just been told I had to quarantine for 14 days and they said "you should make me a PS5 bot!". So I obliged.

I started by reading a few articles on the net and then dived right in to it.

I decided to build in Python and here we are.

## Installation

```bash
bash ./scripts/install.sh
```

6. Copy the folder.
7. Create a new folder inside this repo called 'Chrome'.
8. Paste the profile folder inside the 'Chrome' folder.
